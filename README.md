# Java-Assignments
I am Abdiel from the Software Development course (CEN 3024C-31950).
This respository is for the Java coding assignments that I made in the COP 2805C course. For example, the FirstClass.java file was the first Java application that I created using the Eclipse IDE. It's a simple code that outputs the income of workers depending of the amount of sales they have managed to accomplish by increments of $1000.
